Option 2: Use a Local Web Server in Visual Studio Code (If you have VS Code installed)

If you're using Visual Studio Code (VS Code), you can install an extension to quickly set up a local server:

    Open VS Code and go to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X).
    Search for the extension "Live Server" and install it.
    Open your project folder in VS Code.
    Right-click on your index.html file and select "Open with Live Server".

This will open your project in a local server at http://127.0.0.1:5500/ (or another port, depending on your setup).
